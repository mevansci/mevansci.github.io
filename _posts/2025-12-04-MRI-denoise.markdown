Introduced additive noise to pre-processed images sampled from the distribution MRI is most vulnerable to during acquisition time. Applied non-local means filtering to denoise the MR images and plot the residual distribution of the noise. Our denoising algorithm achieves a SNR percent increase of up to 39.8%, and we show experimentally that the Rician distribution is approximately Gaussian for high SNR.
