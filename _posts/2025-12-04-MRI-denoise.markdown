Pre-processed magnitude MR images and added noise sampled from the distribution MRI is most vulnerable to during acquisition time. Restored the images with non-local means filtering and plotted the residual distribution of the noise. Achieved a SNR percent increase of up to 39.8%, and experimentally verified that the Rician distribution is approximately Gaussian for high SNR.
