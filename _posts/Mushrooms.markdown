Applied transfer learning to the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) for target identification with MARCBot: a surveillance robot capable of identifying, tracking, and following individuals with PyTorch. Fine-tuned the motion planning algorithm in MATLAB for target following through tight, cluttered environments, enabling safe indoor operation previously limited to outdoor use.
